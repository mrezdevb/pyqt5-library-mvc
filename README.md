# ðŸ“¦ Release v1.7.0

## ðŸš€ New Features
- **Advanced Book Filtering in UI**  
  - Added a filter option in the **Show Books** view allowing users to switch between:
    - **All Books** â€“ Displays all registered books.
    - **Available Books** â€“ Displays only books that are not currently borrowed.
- **Smart Search Messages**  
  - Search messages are now more informative and context-aware:
    - If no book is found â†’ *"No books found for `<keyword>`."*
    - If books exist but are all borrowed â†’ *"Books matching `<keyword>` are currently borrowed."*
  - This helps users know when a book exists but is temporarily unavailable.

- Optimized table rendering for faster updates when changing filters or performing searches.
